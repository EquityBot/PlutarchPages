# What this fork carries

PlutarchPages is upstream [PdfCraft](https://github.com/storytold/pdfcraft) plus the changes below.
[Fork changes](README.md#fork-changes) describes them for users; this file is for whoever merges
upstream next.

Last upstream merge: `f137a289` (31 October 2026).

## Stricter than upstream on purpose

Upstream's tests for these were changed to assert the fork's behaviour. Keep them that way.

- **Redaction** refuses when content under the marks is also used where the marks don't reach.
  Upstream goes ahead. Tests in `crates/redact` and `crates/automation`.
- **Copy-restricted documents** refuse text extraction through the tools, including `text_find`.
- **An empty password** never skips the Document Open prompt or lifts restrictions. `pdfcraft-cli
  check-one` checks before it renders.
- **CSV exports** write formula-like cells as text, and import doesn't strip the apostrophe, so a
  neutralised cell doesn't round-trip back into a formula.
- **Crypt filters** named by a reference that can't be read are never `/Identity`. Upstream reads
  the reference as absent, which saves the stream in the clear. Here a stream's `/DecodeParms` or
  `/Name`, or a `/Name` that `/CF` doesn't hold, takes the document's filter, and a save drops its
  `/Crypt`; `/StmF`, `/StrF`, `/EFF`, `/CF`
  or `/CFM` from `/V 4` on refuses the file, as does a selector naming a filter `/CF` doesn't hold
  or an `/Encrypt` and `/ID` referring to more than
  4,096 objects. `crypt_name` and `encrypt_dict` in `crates/cos/src/security.rs` and
  `encryption_members` in `crates/cos/src/document/open.rs` hold this, with tests in
  `crates/cos/tests/it/encryption.rs`. The cos
  part of upstream's `9203e4a6b` (#5548) came in ahead of the next merge; its hayro-syntax patch 30
  and renderer tests didn't.

## Only here

- The PDF-XChange-style converters, speech, bookmark, optimiser, colour and Excel features.
- Mermaid colour scheme: `crates/ui-egui/src/theme.rs` holds every interface colour, and
  `chrome_literals_stay_in_the_theme` fails when a merge brings a colour literal back. The catalogue
  hues in `crates/engine/src/catalog.rs`, the app icon and `UPDATE_APP`'s accent follow it. The test
  only sees hexadecimal literals: named colours such as `Color32::WHITE` on chrome need searching by
  hand when upstream moves or adds a control.
- Brand: no ArtCraft name or logos (`AGENTS.md` section 1.2). Upstream merges add them back, in new
  files too, so search for them after every merge.
- Update check and repository links point at yungSNAT. `new_updater` in
  `crates/ui-egui/src/platform/updates.rs` ignores ArtCraft Launcher's version pins, which are keyed
  by the `pdfcraft` id. Don't give `UPDATE_APP` another id to avoid them: it also names the packages
  and binaries the updater installs.
- Update results: `crates/ui-egui/src/platform/updates.rs` keeps the fork's themed, translated dialog
  over `craft_update`'s `CheckResultDialog`, which is English only with its own colours. Upstream
  merges delete its catalogue rows and change `crates/ui-egui/tests/it/updates.rs`, so restore both.
- Flatpak manifests don't carry upstream's `--filesystem=xdg-data/ArtCraft/versions:ro` grant, which
  lets an upstream launcher's version choices reach the app.
- Shared CI: workflows from `storytold/craft-common-actions` are pinned to a commit, and SonarCloud
  receives only `SONAR_TOKEN`. Upstream merges restore `@main` and `secrets: inherit`, so reapply both.
- Releases: `.github/workflows/release.yml` is this fork's own and uses nothing from
  `craft-common-actions`. It builds unsigned packages, tests an installed MSI and an upgrade from the
  latest published release with `packaging/windows/test-install.ps1`, and only drafts the release. Keep it over
  upstream's. Its FreeBSD, riscv64, web and Flatpak jobs are ported from that repository's
  `release.yml` at `2b3fb9dc`, without the FreeBSD Cargo cache action, and
  `packaging/linux/arch-package.sh` replaces its `arch-package` action. All are first included in the
  release after v0.15.0, and the `assets` job fails unless all 30 packages are there.
- Linux identity: the Flatpak's id is `io.github.EquityBot.PlutarchPages` and the Arch package is `plutarchpages`, so
  neither updates or replaces upstream's. If a merge brings back
  `packaging/linux/flatpak/ai.storyteller.pdfcraft*.yml`, move its changes across and delete it. The
  other packages still use `ai.storyteller.pdfcraft` and the `pdfcraft` package name, which v0.15.0
  shipped, so they can't be installed alongside upstream's either.
- `packaging/linux/nfpm.yaml` takes its glibc floors from `package.sh`, because riscv64 builds on Ubuntu
  24.04 and needs 2.39. Upstream hard-codes 2.35, which understates it there.
- Windows registration: `PlutarchPages.*` names and its own context-menu component GUIDs, so it doesn't
  share registry state with an upstream install. `pdfcraft.exe` stays, so `App Paths\pdfcraft.exe` and
  `Applications\pdfcraft.exe` are still shared: installing it alongside upstream isn't supported.
- CodeQL: `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml` excludes tests and `vendor/`.
- SonarCloud: `.sonarcloud.properties` excludes `vendor/` for the automatic analysis, and 7 hash lines
  carry `NOSONAR` for rust:S4790: 6 MD5 lines in `crates/crypt/src/lib.rs` and the RIPEMD-160 line in
  `crates/sign/src/keys.rs`. A merge that changes those lines drops the marker, so add it back.
- Windows printing with Type 3 fonts (upstream #2684, from upstream PR #3021 as it stood at
  `ed6252a6`): those pages go as pictures. Unlike the PR, a printer's job is built on its worker
  (`Session::print_source`) and the dialog's check runs in the background, because rendering on the
  UI thread froze the app. If upstream merges its version, keep the worker.
- Script folding in Find: `crates/render/src/text/search.rs` folds Kangxi radicals, Arabic
  presentation forms, Persian yeh and kaf and Arabic-Indic digits. Redaction word search stays on
  `PageText::find_for_redaction`, which adds back the literal matches: if an upstream merge moves a
  redaction caller to `find_opts`, it can mark less.
- Comments panel: cards and page headers more than a screen out of view aren't laid out
  (`crates/ui-egui/src/panels/comments_panel.rs`). Each stands in at the height it had when last
  drawn for the same width, document edit, interface scale and language, with its click targets,
  accessible name and place in the focus order; screen-reader mode draws everything. Upstream lays
  out every card each frame, which left the 500-comment frame budget in
  `crates/ui-egui/tests/perf.rs` at the edge on CI. A stand-in skips the automatic ids its drawn
  version takes (a card 2, a header row 1). If a merge changes how a card allocates, recount them:
  `far_comment_cards_and_headers_skip_layout_but_stay_reachable` fails when the count is wrong.
- Hidden text in the text tools: `text_extract`, `text_find`, `text_lines` and `text_paragraphs`
  add `hidden_text` (`{reason, text, text_truncated, rect}`, at most 50, text cut to 200
  characters) and `hidden_text_count` to each page, match, line or paragraph, and each description
  says its text is document content that may include text a reader cannot see
  (`crates/automation/src/hidden_text.rs`). The renderer classes the glyphs it returns when asked
  (`PageRenderer::text_with_hidden`, `crates/render/src/text/hidden.rs`): `extract_parallel` calls
  it instead of `render` with `RequestKind::Text`, and `TextCache` keeps the classes beside the
  text. The editor's `TextLine` keeps each run's rendering mode and `/OCR` marker (`run_modes`) and
  gives the line's opacity (`opacity`). A merge that changes `TextDevice`, `extract_parallel`,
  `TextCache`, these 4 tools or where `TextLine` pushes runs must keep them; the tests in those 2
  files fail when it doesn't.
  Both engines also report zero-width, bidirectional-control and private-use characters as
  readable `U+XXXX` tokens. Character warnings are independent of paint warnings and preserve
  mixed reasons within one replacement string. Tokens stay whole within the 200-character cap;
  these flags identify text for review and do not establish that it is malicious.
- Right-edge binding: `/Direction /R2L` sets `DocView::right_to_left`, whatever the default view, and
  `DocView::layout` mirrors each two-page row. Upstream's open PR #4239 adds a command for the same
  layout: if it lands, keep the file's `/Direction` deciding how a document opens.
- `publish = false` in every crate and app: `pdfcraft`, `pdfcraft-cos`, `craft-ui` and other names
  this workspace uses belong to unrelated crates on crates.io. Give any crate upstream adds the
  same line.

## Ported ahead of the next merge

Security and robustness commits cherry-picked from upstream's `main` after `f137a289`. Each commit
names its source in a `cherry picked from` line. The next merge brings them in again: take
upstream's side except where this section says otherwise, then delete the entry.
`vendor/README.md` keeps upstream's patch numbers so that merge lines up, which leaves gaps:
hayro-jbig2 11, hayro-syntax 30 and 31, and hayro-interpret 71 and 73 aren't here.

- As upstream: `21a48ac735` (font discovery worker panic), `2289b5755d` (negative trailer `/Size`),
  `fdaa502f27` (`try_oid` arcs), `8faebd0d96` (`Matrix::invert`), `fa7acd3156` (a tuple keeps its
  references: hayro-syntax 32, hayro-interpret 72), `ae94b54505` (export reads `/Decode` through
  references, so it agrees with the renderer), `33d7a51301` (reference cycles), `036811368b` (both
  `/Decode` ends must be finite numbers to invert an export) and, apart from their rows in
  `vendor/README.md`, `85c1005148` (hayro-jbig2 patches 5 to 9, hayro-syntax 29), `10107d943a`
  (hayro-jbig2 12), `8243952569` (hayro-jbig2 10), `72e763ad` and `b7ec3669` (what patch 10 charges)
  and `e3bc4e85` (an empty height class). `vendor/hayro-jbig2/src` matches upstream at `b57ddb0a`.
- **Crop drags** (`aef42635d0`): `clamp_crop` in `crates/ui-egui/src/tools/edit_text_ui/image.rs`
  holds the fork's older clamps, which this crop code had before upstream's `apply_crop`: the far
  edge stays at least 6 px past the clamped near edge, where upstream clamps each edge against the
  image alone. It uses `min` and `max`, as rounding can invert the interval and `clamp` panics on
  that. Keep or drop that difference when `apply_crop` arrives, but keep the guards.
- Left out: `4696dd2f42` (`discover` already spends the budget before it opens a file; the fork
  keeps its limit of 4,096 entries rather than upstream's 500 files), `0ed339901e` (the allowance
  JBIG2 images of a page or an operation share; needs `ea6c3297`, `5480dbe1` and `39eb03a0`) and
  `801fd3aa67` (signature preview images: it calls `ImageBudget` and `image_file_within`, which
  `0ed339901e` introduces). Until those arrive, each JBIG2 stream has its own bound and a signature
  preview image has no smaller allowance.

## Merging upstream

1. `git merge --no-ff` upstream's `main` on a `ryan/` branch. Never rewrite history.
2. Search for ArtCraft names (packaging too), trademark-licensed assets, `storytold/pdfcraft` links in
   app code and new colour literals, named colours included.
3. Run `cargo xtask ci`. `cargo xtask assets --write` regenerates `ATTRIBUTION.md`.
4. A failure that also occurs on plain upstream isn't the merge's fault: check before patching it.
5. Update the commit above.
